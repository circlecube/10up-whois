## Who Is 10up?

This react app was built after using some PRI training to learn me some react. I was thinking about what sample project I could create when I saw 3 consecutive emails announcing new 10up employees. Being a company of 200+ is a lot of new faces to learn (especially when we're all working remote). So I thought about a little quiz app that could load everyone and use some classic gamification to encourage us to get to know each others names.

This is scraping the [10up website team](https://10up.com/about) information. And using a simple firebase implementation to store high scores.

## Ideas for updates

Connect to internal.10up.com via an api endpoint to pull more information like pods, groups, location, start date, etc.
Allow for other details for fun one off quiz trivia.
Authenticate with 10up account to set current user and ensure data is private. (Currently public since only data used is publicly available).
Allow for shorter quiz, trying to win with 200+ questions is too long! (sorry, no project to bill that time to!).

## The app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
